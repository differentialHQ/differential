# Differential

Differential allows you to break up your monolithic services into highly malleable and composable services, without the boilerplate.

## The Problem

You have a well-architected monolith. You've determined that it's time to break it up into 2 or more services. But the overhead of going for a service-oriented/microservices architecture is traditionally very high. You have to:

1. Figure out which functionality to break out into a service
2. Split up the code
3. Decide on a service communication protocol (HTTP, gRPC, tRPC, etc)
4. Copy paste boilerplate code for each service and/or write libraries to abstract away the boilerplate
5. Set up obervability / health checks / etc for each service
6. Write/move the business logic for each service
7. Write the service intefaces for each service (e.g. protobufs, OpenAPI, ts-rest/zod)
8. Document the interplay of services for other developers

This is a lot of work, and it's not even the fun part of building a product. If business requirements change and you need to change the boundaries of your services, you have to do it all over again.

### This leads many engineering teams to:

1. Delay breaking up their monoliths when it would be beneficial to do so, or..
2. Break it up early and suffer the consequences of a poorly architected services architecture.

## The Solution

Differential is an application code aware service mesh. It is designed to bring the aforementioned overhead to near-zero.

# Overview

This is a mono-repo for almost all of the Differential codebase. It contains the following repositories:

## Application

- [Control Plane](./control-plane/) The control plane is the central command & control for a differential cluster. This is fully open source and can be run on your own infrastructure without using the cloud offering.
- [Typescript SDK](./ts-core/) The Typescript SDK is the main way to interact with Differential. It is used to define services, call services, and run services.

## Auxiliary

- [Docs](./docs/) The docs are the main source of information for Differential. They are hosted at [docs.differential.dev](https://docs.differential.dev).
- [Changeset Builder](./changeset-builder/) A utility to help us manage changesets and packages across all of our packages.
