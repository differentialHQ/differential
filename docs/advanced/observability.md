# Observability

Status: **In Development**

Differential comes with built-in observability that allows you to see what's happening in your services in real-time, with zero configuration. You can see live payloads, events, and errors in the Differential dashboard, right down to a function call - or up to a cluster level.

To access telemetry data, you can use the Differential dashboard, with support for the CLI coming soon.
