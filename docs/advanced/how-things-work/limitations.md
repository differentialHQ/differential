# Limitations

## Programming language

Differential only supports TypeScript until it gets to a stable release. We do plan to support other languages in the future, however we are intensely focused on creating the right abstractions for a single language first.

There's nothing preventing your from using Differential with JavaScript, however you will lose out on the type safety that Differential provides for your clients.
